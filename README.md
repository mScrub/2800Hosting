# 2800-202210-DTC06 - UCAN

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Our team, UCAN, is developing a web
application to help Ukrainian refugees who
have arrived into Canada to adapt their new
life in the country by providing a platform that
connects people who are willing to offer help
and Ukrainian refugees who would appreciate
support from others.

## Our Team


# To get started

In order to get started, you need to clone our repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/mScrub/2800Hosting.git
```
Run the following command to install all the dependencies:

``` 
cd 2800-202210-DTC06
npm install
```

and then run the following command to start the server:

```
node start server.js
```
or run the following command to start the server in production mode:

```
nodemon server.js
```

If you would like to use our application but connect to your own database, in the `server.js` file, you can change the `mongoose.connect` on line 88 and `app.use(sessions{uri:})` on line 100 line to your own database url.
